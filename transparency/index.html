            <p>
                the very person behind all of this. This document is a message
                unlike any other you'll encounter on this website. In it, I'm
                tying to be as objective, transparent and friendly as humanly
                possible, covering topics such as the origin of the service,
                its purpose and sustainability.
            </p>
            <p>
                I started this project as a way for me to learn front end development
                (because learning something without applying the knowledge yields
                next to no results). Never, ever have I thought it'd come to this.
                On the very first day I just created a pretty simple login form.
                The problem... is that the shiny orange "LOGIN" button did nothing.
                After playing around for two to three days I sort of forgot
                about this project for a month. Then, Order (the original name) was
                starting to take shape. The back end was originally written in C#, a
                language I'm familiar with. Then it got rewritten in Erlang, a totally
                new platform with a different set of concepts. At the end of the day every
                technology directly involved in this project is a new one for me.
            </p>
            <p>
                As the project grew from a basic login form into a full-blown service,
                I had to decide what it should and should not be.
            </p>
            <p style="font-weight: bold;">
                I'm aiming to create a messenger with some limited social network functions.
                One that can be trusted for everyday, secret and emergency communication;
                that seeks no goal to make money beyond the amount needed to keep it
                running, and therefore has no reason to collect and sell data. My promise
                is that as long I'm in control of the operation, this core philosophy is
                never going to change.

                Should you use Yamka? It depends. See for yourself: below are comparisons
                to Signal, Discord and Matrix.
            </p>
            <p>
                <p style="font-weight: bold;">To Signal</p>
                <p>➕ We offer a greater "cosmetic" feature set</p>
                <p>➕ Your groups can be publicly
                listed and discovered by anyone if you wish to do so</p>
                <p>➕ The entire stack is open. Signal maintainers are not really that open
                about their back end</p>
                <p>➖ End-To-End Encryption (E2EE) is only available in direct messages</p>
            </p>
            <p>
                <p style="font-weight: bold;">To Discord</p>
                <p>➕ E2EE</p>
                <p>➕ No data is collected, sold or given away</p>
                <p>➕ You retain ownership of the works you upload</p>
                <p>➕ Any group of any size can be made public and searched for</p>
                <p>➖ I can't really think of any</p>
            </p>
            <p>
                <p style="font-weight: bold;">To Matrix</p>
                <p>➕ A unified and centralized service, therefore it's more user-friendly.
                Matrix is really a protocol like email. There is no such thing as
                "The Email", just like there is no "The Matrix"</p>
                <p>➖ A unified and centralized service, therefore if we as a group
                are no more, the service is too along with all of your data</p>
                <p>➖ End-To-End Encryption (E2EE) is only available in direct messages</p>
            </p>
            <p>
                <p style="font-weight: bold;">To all of the above</p>
                <p>➕ Extremely lightweight custom protocol</p>
                <p>➕ Even more lightweight separate emergency notification protocol.
                Requires less than 100 bytes including UDP, IP and Ethernet headers
                to send one with no prior connection setup.</p>
                <p>➖ "Small" is a word that doesn't even come close to describing
                the size of the community at the time (like 5 people lmao)</p>
                <p>➖ Lots of bugs</p>
